## Background Context

"Fix My Code" is a new type of project where we jump into an existing codebase and fix it! Sometimes you will know the language, and sometimes you won't. Please download the repository `0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge` and use it as the initial files for all solutions. You should not recode everything, just fix it!

This project is NOT mandatory at all. It is 100% optional. Doing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. Your score won't get hurt if you don't do it, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might go down. Have fun!

## Requirements

**General**
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line

## Tasks

### 0. FizzBuzz

- Please take a look at my implementation of FizzBuzz in Python: [source code](https://github.com/missVM/Fix_My_Code_Challenge/blob/main/0x00-challenge/0-fizzbuzz.py)

- Something is going wrong...

  ```shell
  $ ./0-fizzbuzz.py 50
  1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 Fizz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz Fizz 22 23 Fizz Buzz 26 Fizz 28 29 Fizz 31 32 Fizz 34 Buzz Fizz 37 38 Fizz Buzz 41 Fizz 43 44 Fizz 46 47 Fizz 49 Buzz
15 should print FizzBuzz, not Fizz
